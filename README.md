# PHP CRUD Application with MySQL Database

## Description
This PHP CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application provides a simple yet effective way to manage user data stored in a MySQL database. CRUD operations are fundamental in web development, allowing users to interact with and manipulate data within an application. This project demonstrates the basic functionalities of CRUD operations using PHP and MySQL, along with Bootstrap for styling.

## How to Use
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Import the included SQL file (`crud.sql`) into your MySQL database to set up the required table structure.
3. Configure the `connect.php` file with your database credentials (hostname, username, password, and database name).
4. Open the application in a web browser.
5. Use the provided forms to perform CRUD operations:
   - **Add User:** Navigate to `user.php` to add new user entries.
   - **View Users:** Navigate to `display.php` to view existing user entries.
   - **Update User:** Click the "Update" button next to a user entry on the display page to modify their details.
